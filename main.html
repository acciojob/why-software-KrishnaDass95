	<h1>Why I want to become a developer</h1>
	<p>Programming has been really fun to learn, 
	the opportunities and the benefits working a 
		software gig is numerous. It seems like a very practical
		career to be in. I'd like to learn to program well to 
		create and build new cool things through code. Maybe applications 
		and even robots? haha.
